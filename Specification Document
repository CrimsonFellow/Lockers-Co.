6. Core Concepts
1.	Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
•	 Classes such as FileManager, FileOperationsMenu, and MainMenu encapsulate behavior and state.
2.	Methods and Functions:
•	Methods like showWelcomeScreen(), showMainMenu(), and various file operation methods perform specific functionalities.
3.	User Input Handling:
•	Methods like addFile(), deleteFile(), and searchFile() take user input for file operations.
4.	Flow Control (Loops and Conditionals):
•	Loops control the continuous display of menus, and conditionals handle user choices.
5.	Arrays and Collections:
•	The LinkedList<String> in FileOperationsMenu.
6.	Exception Handling:
•	The Scanner usage is wrapped with exception handling to manage unexpected inputs.
7.	File I/O (Input/Output):
•	Reading and writing files would be critical for a fully functional file manager.
8.	Sorting Algorithms:
•	The Arrays.sort() method is applied to sort file names alphabetically.
9.	User Interface Design:
•	The welcome screen and menu displays provide a basic user interface.
10.	Version Control (Git and GitHub):
•	Commits, branches, and repositories on GitHub help track changes and collaborate with others.

7. Conclusion
The sprint aims to deliver a functional prototype of LockedMe.com with essential file management features.
Continuous improvement
